# Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Fake News Detection

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that implement various machine learning models to detect fake news using traditional and deep learning methods.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

```
pip install matplotlib.pyplot
pip install nltk
pip install nltk.corpus
pip install nltk.tokenize
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install re
pip install sklearn.ensemble
pip install sklearn.feature_extraction.text
pip install sklearn.linear_model
pip install sklearn.metrics
pip install sklearn.model_selection
pip install sklearn.naive_bayes
pip install tensorflow
pip install tensorflow.keras.layers
pip install tensorflow.keras.models
pip install tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence
pip install tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text
pip install tensorflow.keras.utils
pip install transformers
```

## Datasets

The project utilises the LIAR dataset for training, validation, and testing. The dataset includes the following files:
- `train.tsv` - Used for training the models.
- `valid.tsv` - Used for model validation.
- `test.tsv` - Used for testing the models.
and a README.md file of its own


## Notebooks

The repository includes the following notebooks:
- LSTM.ipynb: Implements LSTM models for sequence processing.
- CNNs.ipynb: Implements Convolutional Neural Networks for text classification.
- MachineLearningFND.ipynb: Implements traditional machine learning models like logistic regression, random forests, and multinomial naive Bayes.
- SigmondFunction.ipynb: Provides visualisation and analysis of the Sigmond (logistic) function.
